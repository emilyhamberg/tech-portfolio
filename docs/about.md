Hi! I'm Emily Hamberg, a Minneapolis-based software QA Engineer at Surescripts. I enjoy learning new things and working together with my team to solve challenges. Currently focused on UI testing with Selenium and backend API testing, among other things!

In my free time I enjoy perfecting my home latte art, hearing live music (in pre-COVID times), and trying to keep my plants alive with my balcony's one-hour-of-sun per day. I endeavor to visit all of the National Parks in the US in my lifetime! [14 seen so far]

## Current Role

I am a QA Engineer at Surescripts, where I design automated and manual test cases across multiple environments while working closely with developers, product management, and fellow QA engineers. I also serve as my team's scrum master - running the team's daily standups and fortnightly retrospectives.
